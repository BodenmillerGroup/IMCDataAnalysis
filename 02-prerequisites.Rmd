# Prerequisites

Before we get started on IMC data analysis, we will need to make sure that
software dependencies are installed and the needed example data is downloaded.

## Software requirements

## Download example data

Throughout this tutorial, we will access a number of different data types. 
To declutter the analysis scripts, we will already download all needed data here.

### Files for spillover matrix estimation

To highlight the generation of a spillover matrix, we will use files that were 
provided in the original publication [@Chevrier2017].

```{r dowload-chevrier2017, message=FALSE}
sm_url <- "https://data.mendeley.com/public-files/datasets/v58yj49pfr/files/b39223d2-2825-4e79-9875-86fa0e1c55d2/file_downloaded?dl=1"

download.file(sm_url, "data/Figure_S5.zip")
unzip("data/Figure_S5.zip", exdir="data", overwrite=TRUE)
unlink("data/Figure_S5.zip")
```
