# IMC Data Analysis Workflow {#preamble}

**This project is under development and will change on a regular basis**

Upon release, this workflow highlights the use of common R/Bioconductor packages
to pre-process and analyze single-cell data obtained from segmented IMC images.
While we use IMC data as an example, the concepts presented here can be applied
to images obtained by other highly-multiplexed imaging technologies (e.g. CODEX,
MIBI, mIF, etc.). The workflow can be largely divided into the following parts:

1. Pre-processing (reading in the data, spillover correction)
2. Metrics for quality control
3. Low-dimensional visualization, clustering and/or cell-type classification
4. Visualization of cell- and pixel-level information
5. Spatial analyses
