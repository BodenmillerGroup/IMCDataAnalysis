# Preamble {#preamble}

**This project is under development and will change on a regular basis**

Upon release, this workflow highlights the use of common R/Bioconductor packages
to pre-process and analyze single-cell data obtained from segmented IMC images.
While we use IMC data as an example, the concepts presented here can be applied
to images obtained by other technologies (e.g. CODEX, MIBI, mIF, etc.). The
workflow can be largely divided into the following parts:

1. Pre-processing (reading in the data, spillover correction)
2. Metrics for quality control
3. Low-dimensional visualization, clustering and/or cell-type classification
4. Visualization of cell- and pixel-level information
5. Spatial analyses
