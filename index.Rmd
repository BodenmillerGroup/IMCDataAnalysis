# IMC Data Analysis Workflow {#preamble}

**This project is under development and will change on a regular basis**

Upon release, this workflow highlights the use of common R/Bioconductor packages
to analyze single-cell data obtained from segmented imaging mass cytometry (IMC)
images. We will not perform multi-channel image processing and segmentation in R
but rather link to available approaches in Section \@ref(processing). While we
use IMC data as an example, the concepts presented here can be applied to images
obtained by other highly-multiplexed imaging technologies (e.g. CODEX, MIBI,
mIF, etc.).

We will give an introduction to IMC in Section \@ref(intro) and highlight
strategies to extract single-cell data from IMC images in Section
\@ref(processing).

Reproducible code written in R is available from Section \@ref(prerequisites)
onwards and the workflow can be largely divided into the following parts:

1. Pre-processing (reading in the data, spillover correction)
2. Metrics for quality control
3. Low-dimensional visualization, clustering and/or cell-type classification
4. Visualization of cell- and pixel-level information
5. Spatial analyses
