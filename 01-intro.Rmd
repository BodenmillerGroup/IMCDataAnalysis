# Introduction {#intro}

Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) utilizes metal-tagged antibodies to detect up to 40
proteins, or other molecules which may be labelled in biological samples. As
such, it is a leading technology to perform highly-multiplexed imaging (HMI)
particularly suited to profile small (1 mm$^2$) areas of tissue slices
across hundreds of samples.

IMC has first been published in 2014 [@Giesen2014] and has been commercialised by
Fluidigm<sup>&reg;</sup> to be distributed as the Hyperion<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> imaging
system (documentation is available
[here](https://www.fluidigm.com/products-services/instruments/hyperion)).
Similar to other HMI technologies such as MIBI [@Angelo2014], CyCIF [@Lin2018],
4i [@Gut2018], CODEX [@Goltsev2018] and SABER [@Saka2019], IMC captures the spatial
expression of multiple proteins in parallel. With 1 &mu;m resolution, IMC is able to
detect cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of proteins. The default ablation
frequency of IMC is set to 200Hz, meaning a 1 mm$^2$ area can be imaged
within ~2 hours.

## Technical details

Technical aspects of how data acquisition works can be found in the original
publication [@Giesen2014]. Briefly, antibodies to detect targets in biological
material are labeled with heavy metals (e.g. lanthanides) which do not occur in
biological systems and can therefore be used as a readout similar to
fluorophores in fluorescence microscopy. Thin sections of the biological sample
on a glass slide are stained with an antibody cocktail and dried after staining.
Stained microscopy slides are mounted on a precise motor driven stage inside the
ablation chamber of the IMC. A high energy UV laser is focused on the tissue and
any individual laser shot will ablate tissue from an area of roughly 1
&mu;m$^2$. The energy of the laser is absorbed by the tissue which leads
to vaporization and partial ionization followed by condensation of the ablated
material. The ablated material from each laser shot is transported in the gas
phase into the plasma of the CyTOF where exhaustive ionization of the particles
occurs. The ionized particle cloud is then focused into a vacuum and all ions
below a mass of 80 Da are filtered via a quadrupole mass analyzer. The remaining
ions (mostly those used to tag antibodies) are analyzed in a time of flight mass
spectrometer to obtain an accumulated mass spectrum from all ions that
correspond to a single laser shot. One can regard this spectra as the underlying
information for a 1&nbsp;&mu;m$^2$ pixel. With repetitive laser shots (e.g.
200 Hz) and a simultaneous lateral sample movement a tissue can be ablated pixel
by pixel and ultimately an image is reconstructed from each pixel mass spectra.

In principle IMC can be applied to the same type of samples as conventional
fluorescence microscopy. The largest distinction from fluorescence microscopy is
that for IMC primary labelled antibodies are commonly used while in fluorescence
microscopy secondary antibodies carrying fluorophores are widely applied.
Additionally, for IMC samples are dried before acquisition. Formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples are most widely used where FFPE blocks are cut
to 2-5 &mu;m thick sections for subsequent staining. Once the sections are
stained and dried slides are ready for acquisition with IMC.


### Metal-conjugated antobodies and staining

Metal-labeled antibodies are used to stain tissue structures, cells and
molecules within cells. Metal conjugated antibodies can either be purchased
directly from Fluidigm ([MaxPar IMC Antibodies](
https://store.fluidigm.com/Cytometry/ConsumablesandReagentsCytometry/MaxparAntibodies?cclcl=en_US))
or antibodies can be purchased and labeled individually ([MaxPar Antibody
Labelling](https://store.fluidigm.com/Cytometry/ConsumablesandReagentsCytometry/MaxparAntibodyLabelingKits?cclcl=en_US)).
Of general note: antibody labeling using the MaxPar kits is performed via TCEP
antibody reduction followed by crosslinking with sulfhydryl-reactive
maleimide-bearing metal polymers. Not all antibodies are functional after
labeling and it is crucial to use those antibodies that provide sufficient
signal intensity and specificity after conjugation. To facilitate antibody
handling a database is almost mandatory for any IMC or other HMI users.
[Airlab](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/airlab-web) is such a platform and
allows antibody lot tracking, validation data uploads and panel generation for
subsequent upload to the IMC acquisition software from Fluidigm.

Depending on the sample type, different staining protocols can be used.
Generally, once antibodies of choice have been found and conjugated, titration
experiments are commonly performed to identify the optimal staining
concentration. Even for FFPE samples different staining protocols exist and
different antibodies show variable staining based on the applied protocol. For a
start, protocols such as the one provided by Fluidigm ([Fluidigm staining
protocol]()) or the one describe by [@Ijsselsteijn2019] are recommended. Briefly,
for FFPE tissues, a dewaxing step is performed to dissolve the paraffin used to
embed the material, followed by a graded re-hydration of the samples.
Thereafter, heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER), a step aiming at the reversal
of formalin based fixation, is used to unmask epitopes within tissues and make
them accessible to antibodies. Epitope unmasking is generally performed in
either basic, EDTA based buffers (pH 9.2) or acidic, citrate based buffers  (pH
6). Next, a bovine serum albumin containing buffer is used to block unspecific
binding. This buffer is also used to dilute antibody stocks for the actual
antibody staining. Staining time and temperature may vary and
optimisation/testing is inevitable. However, over night staining at 4&deg;C or
3-5 hours at room temperature seem to be suited in many cases.

Following antibody incubation, unbound antibodies are washed away and a
counterstain comparable to DAPI is applied to enable the identification of
nuclei. The [Iridium
intercalator](https://store.fluidigm.com/Cytometry/ConsumablesandReagentsCytometry/MassCytometryReagents/Cell-ID%E2%84%A2%20Intercalator-Ir%E2%80%94125%20%C2%B5M)
from Fluidigm is a reagent of choice and applied in a brief 5 minute staining.
Finally, the samples are washed again and then dried under an airflow. Once
dried, the samples are read for acquisition and usually stable for a long period
of time (at least one year).

### Data acquisition

Data is acuired using the CyTOF software from Fluidigm (see manuals
[here](https://go.fluidigm.com/hyperion-support-documents)).

Important notes up front: the IMC cannot access roughly 5 mm from each of the
slide edges due to meachnical properties of the build. Currently, the IMC can
also only process one slide at a time and usually one MCD file per sample
slide is generated to contain data (see [below](#data-format)). The regions of
interest to be acquired need to be selected by providing coordinates for
ablation. Since the field of view in the IMC is only about 200 &mu;m in
diameter, so called "panoramas" can be generated. These are stitched images of
single fields of view. Panoramas provide an optical overview of the tissue with
a resolution similar to 10x in microscopy and are intended to help with the
selection of regions of interest for ablation.

Many regions of interest can be defined on a single slide and acquisition
parameters such as channels to acquire, acquisition speed (100 Hz, 200 HZ and
400 HZ - only in Service mode), ablation energy and more have to be defined. Of
note: it is recommended to record all isotope channels and also some channels
pointing towards potential contaminations of the argon gas (e.g. Xenon) or of
the samples (e.g. Lead, Barium). However, the generated raw data will be larger
in size.

To process a large number of slides or to select regions on whole slide samples
sometimes panoramas are not informative enough. For that purpose multi-color
immunofluorescence of the same slide prior to staining with metal-labelled
antibodies may be performed. To allow for region selection based on
immunofluorescence images and also align those images with a Panorama of the
same or consecutive sections of this sample we developed
[napping](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/napping).

Acquisition time is directly proportional to the total size of ablation and
considerable run times for large samples or large sample numbers are to be taken
into account. Additionally, besides the proprietary MCD file format `.txt`
files can also be generated for each region of interest which is recommended as
a back up option in case of errors which may render MCD files corrupt but not
`.txt` files.

## Data format {#data-format}

Upon completion of the acquisition an MCD file of variable size is generated. A
single MCD file can hold raw acquisition data for multiple regions of interest,
optical images providing a slide level overview of the sample ("panoramas"), and
detailed metadata about the experiment. Additionally, for each acquisition a
`.txt` file is generated which holds the same pixel information as the matched
acquisition in the MCD file. 

The Hyperion Imaging System produces files in the following folder structure:

```
.
+-- XYZ_ROI_001_1.txt
+-- XYZ_ROI_002_2.txt
+-- XYZ_ROI_003_3.txt
+-- XYZ.mcd
```

These folders are often zipped to generate individual files per IMC run.

We refer to this data as raw data and the further
processing of this data is described in Section \@ref(processing).
